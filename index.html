        <h4> About Me:</h4>
        <p id = "aboutMe">This fall I began my second year as a SUNY New Paltz student. I transferred from
            SUNY Dutchess after switching my major to computer science. I had originally planned
            to pursue forensic pathology, however, since then I have discovered my passion and 
            curiosity for the field of computer science.
        </p>

        <h4>Favorite Passtimes</h4>
        <p>I love to spend time with my cat, play relaxing video games, watch anime, and
            talk to my friends.
